Review the specified page implementation for the GLM dashboard.

Check for:
1. Pedagogical clarity - is one concept introduced per page?
2. Correct notation (Y vs y, β vs α)
3. Progressive disclosure - are beginner/intermediate/advanced modes considered?
4. Interactivity - does the user need to interact before proceeding?
5. Visual consistency with the flow diagram (X → η → μ → Y → y)

Provide specific suggestions for improvement.
