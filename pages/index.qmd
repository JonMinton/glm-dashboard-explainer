## What problem are you trying to solve?

Different types of data require different statistical models. Select a scenario below to explore how Generalised Linear Models (GLMs) can help.

## How this guide works

This interactive guide will walk you through:

1. **Selecting your variables** - Choose which variable to predict (response) and which variables to use as predictors
2. **Building the model** - Understand the three components: predictor transformers h(X), link function g(), and distribution family f()
3. **Fitting parameters** - See how maximum likelihood estimation finds the best β coefficients
4. **Interpreting results** - Understand what your model tells you about the data

Each step builds on the previous one, revealing the GLM framework piece by piece.

## The GLM Framework

At its core, a GLM connects predictors to a response through this structure:

```
Predictors → Linear combination → Link function → Expected value → Distribution → Observed data
    X            η = Xβ              g⁻¹(η)            μ              f(μ,α)           y
```

- **β** (beta): Coefficients that weight each predictor
- **g()**: Link function that maps between linear predictor and expected value
- **f()**: Distribution family that describes how observations scatter around their expected values
- **Y**: The random variable (what the model predicts could happen)
- **y**: The observed data (what actually happened)
