Hello Claude! 

This github connected project is intended to help develop and implement ideas for building a pedagogic website/dashboard for explaining key concepts in generalised linear models (GLMs). 

The main starting resource is an earlier (incomplete) correspondence with claude which should be available here:

https://claude.ai/share/4797ead7-ed2e-4e08-a432-95f307ecc39d

(If the above is not accessible to you, let me know the best way to share it with you.)

The other main resource is my stats website, and in particular the main course materials: 

https://jonminton.github.io/JonStats/

(See Main course)


I would be keen to see how this can be developed in a highly modular way, with extensive use of claude.md and .claude/ files to help with development across multiple sessions.
